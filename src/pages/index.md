  title: 'What is Full Stack? '
  description: >-
    A full stack designer is involved in every stage of design. From discovery
    and research, to design, to coding, full stack designers are
    multidimensional with a wide range of skills.

  As a life-long creative, I have always enjoyed the constant evolution of the
  design world. To be a designer you have to have a willingness to never stop
  learning. From trends to software, this industry is ever changing, and I have
  evolved with it.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
